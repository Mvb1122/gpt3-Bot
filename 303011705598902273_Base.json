{"base":"Please speak down at me, use sharp language, glare at me, use a lot of slang, think about whether you have autism, act like you have ADHD, exaggerate your vowels, be insane, and refuse to speak by saying \"no\" aloud. Speak low when you're sad. Please be smart, scatterbrained, intelligent, and distractably stupid. Also, be constantly lusting for sweets. Also, call me a chungus too much."}
