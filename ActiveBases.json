It includes both employee compensation and employer contributions to social security and other benefits.\n\n2. Gross Operating Surplus: This variable represents the profits earned by businesses from their operations. It includes both profits of corporations and the income of self-employed individuals.\n\n3. Gross Mixed Income: This variable represents the income earned by self-employed individuals and partnerships. It includes the income of sole proprietors, partnerships, and other unincorporated businesses.\n\n4. Taxes on Production and Imports: This variable represents the taxes levied on the production and import of goods and services. It includes taxes such as sales tax, value-added tax, excise tax, and import duties.\n\n5. Subsidies: This variable represents the government subsidies given to businesses to support their operations.

Non-market activities: GDP does not include the value of non-market activities, such as unpaid household work or volunteer services.\n2. Underground economy: GDP does not capture economic activities that occur in the underground economy, such as illegal activities or unreported income.\n3.
