flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop

flowchart LR
    Start --> Stop

The first two letters after "flowchart" describe the direction that nodes are to flow. You can use any of:
TB - Top to bottom
TD - Top-down/ same as top to bottom
BT - Bottom to top
RL - Right to left
LR - Left to right

You can have nodes flow to eachother using IDs: 
flowchart LR
    id --> id2
    id2 --> id3
    id3 --> id

Note that, initially, the ID will be what's displayed in the node but it CANNOT have spaces. 
In order to have nodes with spaces in them, you must use text nodes:
flowchart LR
    id[This is the text in the box] --> id2
    id2 --> id

You must still use the ID to refer to the node when creating relationships between nodes.

You can add subgraphs, as seen in this example:
flowchart TB
    c1-->a2
    subgraph one
    a1-->a2
    end
    subgraph two
    b1-->b2
    end
    subgraph three
    c1-->c2
    end
    one --> two
    three --> two
    two --> c2

There are many different types of nodes you can use: 
flowchart LR
    id1[(This is a database!)]
    id2[[This is the text in the box]]
    id3([This is the text in a rounded square.])
    id4{This is text in a rhombus. It's good for noting split paths.}

If your text includes (parenthesis) in it, you MUST put quotes around it.

Here's an example illustrating a decision:
flowchart TD
    C{"Choose Type"}
    C --> D["Pie"] & E["flowchart"] & F["etc..."] 

As seen above, you can map multiple node connections at once using the & character to note that it's happening to multiple targets. Additionally, note that it's best to use a Rhombus for decisions! 
Remember that a Rhombus will have text in {curly brackets}

There are several different ways of connecting nodes:
flowchart LR
    C -- This is the text! --- D
    C --> D
    C--- |This is the Text!|D
    C-->|text|D
