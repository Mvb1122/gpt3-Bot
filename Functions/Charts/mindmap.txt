You should not match what's above exactly; it's just a guide. Do not include Tony Buzan in your mindmap.
You can change the shape of certain nodes by doing as in this example:

mindmap
    id(I am a rounded square)

You can use (parenthesis) for rounded squares, ((double parenthesis)) for circles.
You can use {{double curly brackets}} for hexagons. DO NOT USE (((triple parenthesis)))! THEY BREAK STUFF.

Here's a really simple example:
mindmap
  Root
      A
        B
        C

You may use icons:
mindmap
    Root
        A
        ::icon(fa fa-book)

When using icons, you must put the icon line beneath the item to have the icon.  All in all, the line should look like:
::icon(fa fa-DESCRIPTION)
Where DESCRIPTION is what you want to be displayed, with dashes instead of spaces.

Here are all of the DESCRIPTION you can use.
