Do not exactly copy what's above; use what we just talked about to make a chart that's unique.
The `quadrant-1` lines are what each quadrant is named. YOU MUST include `quadrant-#` where # is a number 1-4, and then a TITLE to call the quadrant by.
The `Campaign A` type lines are the individual points. YOU MUST start with what you want the point to be named, then put a colon, and then put a POINT contained within [[brackets]] !!!
