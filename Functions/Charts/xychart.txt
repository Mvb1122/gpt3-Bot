    title "Sales Revenue"
    x-axis [jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec]
    y-axis "Revenue (in $)" 4000 --> 11000
    bar [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000]
    line [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000]

You may include both bar and line, or one or the other, but not anything else. You must use either Bar or Line. You must define all numeric values as shown! YOU CANNOT USE ... as a spread operator! YOU MUST WRITE ALL NUMERIC VALUES.
You do not need to include x-axis or y-axis labels for it to be valid.

Here's an extremely simple example that's also valid:

xychart-beta
    line [+1.3, .6, 2.4, -.34]
