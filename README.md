# gpt3-Bot
A discord bot that allows access to ChatGPT and other misc AIs. Also, if you do find an issue, please open a pull request, I guess.

# AI:
As of this moment, I've bridged together ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. The bot is currently running the Stable Diffusion model "AnythingV4.5" because that's what I had acess to on my computer.

# Try it!:
If you want to try the bot, you can [join the discord server](https://discord.com/invite/JNSdRSPBQ4)
